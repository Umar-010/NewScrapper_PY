Greeting Guys !
So excited to tell you about my new python project that I recently made , a news scrapper project having key points

° Extract the required news from the website addresses provided as per the user demand

° Tinkter Gui for a user friendly interface 

° Searches by various methods like if you search a single word all the matching news headlines are shown

° Data is stored in cache for fast response after first execution onwards

° You can export it as a csv file as well
